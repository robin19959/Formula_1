### Introduction
    Team Turts Formula 1 API, brings you closer to the the drivers racing Formula 1.
    üèéÔ∏è What data can you get:
    * All Formula 1 drivers of 2024
    * Driver stats
    * Interact with user-defined presets and preferences stored in our database

### Installation
    The API is setup on local SQLite database, for more flexibility and customization set up own
    database and rearrange the database routes to your own. For guidance to SQLite, 
    refer to the official documentation (see references in the end).

### Requirements
    * Ensure you install have the following tools and packages installed to use the API:
        * Python: The API is built with Python. Make sure python is installed on your system (for link see refereses in the end). 
    
    * Dependencies: The required packages are listed in the 'requirements.txt' file. Can be installed using the followed command:
        *$ bash
    'pip install -r requirements.txt'
   
    * Included packages:
        * 'Flask': Web application framework.
        * 'Requests': User-friendly HTTP library.

### Setup
    1. Clone the repository.
    2. Install dependencies from 'requirements.txt'.
    3. (Optional) Set up own database for more customization.
    4. Set the 'API_SPORTS_KEY' in the 'config.py' for API authentication.
    5. Run 'python man.py' to start the server.


## Project Structure

#### Backend
    * main.py: Script running the Flask API server.
    * config.py - Storing configurations such as API keys (not included in the GitHub repo).
    * F1searchpresets.db: local SQlite database file used for the project.

#### Documentation:
    * 'docs.yaml': Documents API usage, data formats, request examples and more.  

#### API data format
    * Responses are formatted in JSON

#### How the API works
    1. Request data from the API by following the docs.yaml
    2. As data is JSON object format, you're able to retrive specific data by filtering it as {key:value} pairs,
        where you request the key for the value (data) you want. 

    * We currently allow 100 request per day. If more is needed we recommend to cache the data, reference:

### Methods and validations
##### Interacting with external API:
    
    * This API interacts with an external Formula 1 data provider to verify and retrieve current information and stats about drivers.
        Before storing any user 'interests' in the local database 'F1searchpresets.db', the API validates the driver's name against the external API.
        This ensures all user interests are real current drivers of Formula 1 2024.

##### Data validation process
    When a POST request is made to '/presets', the API performs the following steps:
    1. Receives the user's input for driver's name.
    2. Makes a request to the external API to fetch the current list of F1 drivers.
    3. Checks if the submitted driver's name (step 1) exists in the fetched list.
        4. If driver exists, the API proceeds to store the user's preset interest in the database.
        5. If driver does NOT exist, returns an error message refering user to check spelling or current season's driver list.

    Method implemented with purpose to ensure the database remains accurate and up to date with valid F1 driver information. 

#### API Endpoints and Database Methods
    * '/api/docs': Returns the API documentation

    * '/drivers': Returns current F1 driver standings

    * '/presets': Allows retrieval and insertion of user presets (specific driver) in the database 
        * Supports GET and POST if driver's name is valid.

    * '/db/<item_id>': Retrieves or deletes a specific database record based on the ID
        * Supports GET and DELETE row by ID.

#### Improvements
    * API authentication, secure data transmissions.

    * Cache data from external API, which is limited to 100 requests per day. We can update our data cache every 3 times per hour, or 72 times per day.
    This approach would ensure API users can access the data withour directly impacting the limit set by the external API.
